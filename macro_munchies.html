                <h3>Interviews & User Personas</h3>
                <p>To kick off this project, I first held interviews with my user group. During this step, I got some great insight from my users, and ultimately their ideas influenced the design decisions moving forward. With the help of these successful interviews, I could put together my user personas.</p>

                <h3>Project Requirements & User Flow</h3>
                <p>By this time, I began second-guessing what was a “want” versus a “need” for the app to be successful. As a result, I took out most of my app features by mistake, which made my app bland and I wound up wasting time. Thankfully after consulting with my user group, I realized that these features were needed to accomplish their goals. I then revised my documentation, readded these features, and edited my user flow to match.</p>

                <h3>Mood Board</h3>
                <p>For the mood board, I wanted to go with warm and welcoming colors and text to get the user’s attention. I also wanted to make sure that the app’s UI design was more on the simple side to avoid overcrowding the interface and overwhelming the user. Picking the right typefaces and colors in my design was a bit challenging, mainly because I wasn’t sure how to introduce some of the colors in my palette correctly.</p>

                <p>The low-fidelity wireframes below show my plans for both my responsive web design and the complete mobile app. At this stage, I felt like my thought process was more cohesive and put together than in previous steps.</p>

                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>When creating the mockups I enjoyed seeing my hard work pay off. I felt like my designs would not have turned out as well if I had not constantly reached out to my user group for feedback.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3>Retrospective</h3>
                <p>In conclusion, I learned how user feedback is crucial to the UX/UI design process. Keeping my user group involved throughout the project helped me stay the user-focused majority of the time. I also learned to be open to change and inspiration at any time because your initial idea may not make the final cut. I will implement these ideals in my future projects so that I may not lose sight of the project goals.</p>
