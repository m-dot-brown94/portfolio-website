                    <p>Rx Runner is a native app that provides gig workers (independent contractors) with the ability to deliver medication and medical equipment to homes, businesses, and clinics in their city.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this project was to build an app that could easily access maps and complete deliveries on the go.</p>

                <h3>Project Scope and User Flow</h3>
                <p>This step was essential to establish the reason for this project and what the user can accomplish in the app. I immediately knew that this app would be a bit ambitious because I knew it would require at least 10 screens. I still decided to move forward with this challenge because I felt confident with the overall concept compared to my other app ideas.</p>

                <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframe</h3>
                <p>At first, I thought that following iOS Human Interface and Material (Android) guidelines was a bit intimidating because I didn’t think I had as much freedom to choose aspects of the app. However, once I reviewed the guidelines more I realized that there was still much creative freedom for me to make a great app. Therefore, I decided to skip low-fidelity wireframing to save time because I had to create app versions for iOS and Android based on their guidelines.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3>Conducting App Analysis</h3>
                <p>During this phase, I noticed that there weren’t many examples of existing medical courier driver apps in the App Store and Google Play Store. The apps available also require users to register on their website before being able to log in. Coincidentally, I have delivered using apps like DoorDash and Uber. As a driver, we also delivered prescription medications in addition to food so I eventually decided to analyze these apps instead.</p>

                <h3>Prototypes and Conducting User Testing</h3>
                <p>For the next step, I created a prototype and reached out to several people to conduct user testing. During user testing, people shared great insight on how I could make the app feel more cohesive. Since they provided such great feedback, I used the majority of their suggestions and included them in the final version of my wireframe and prototype. This helped the app feel more user-friendly and thought out.</p>

                <h3>High-Fidelity Wireframe</h3>
                <p>This was my favorite part of the process because I was able to bring the app to life. A challenge that I ran into during this phase was establishing what screens would be included in the final version. Though I knew early on that I would have over the recommended number of sides, I struggled a bit with creating a cohesive selection of screens because at this point I still felt like I was missing something. I knew that once I began user feedback, things would come together.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Retrospective</h3>
                <p>In conclusion, I do believe that I met my original goal for this project. I struggled with figuring out which screens to include from the beginning. I was trying to fit this idea within a set number of recommended screens. I also doubted that the result would be great because I tried restricting the app to only 8-12 screens</p>
                <p>After coming to terms with the task at hand, I was able to focus better on the user experience I wanted to implement. I am very pleased with the app’s overall design and I enjoyed putting it together. I exceeded my expectations and I couldn’t have asked for a better outcome.</p>
                <p>In the future, I’d like to be a bit more confident in my choices as a designer. It’s not a bad thing to want to be ambitious; the best ideas come from enthusiasm and motivation to get the job done.</p>
