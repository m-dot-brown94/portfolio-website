                    <p>The Capsule is a web app that gives users the ability to easily shop for the products they need, at any place and time. This was a project I completed as a part of my UI Design boot camp curriculum.</p>

                <h3>Establishing the User Flow & Sketching</h3>
                <p>During this project, I had multiple parts to complete within a day or so of each other. This gave me less time as a whole compared to my previous projects. As a result, I had to make sure that the margin of error was low. This meant I was double and sometimes triple-checking my work for errors each day. When making my user and low fidelity wireframe I made sure not to add too many flows or extra screens, which would overcomplicate the process.</p>

                <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframe & Conducting User Testing</h3>
                <p>Next, I created a more detailed wireframe along with a prototype for user testing. While in the feedback phase, I was able to observe how well users were navigating the app and completing the task provided. I feel like this step had the most impact on the project because I could observe their movements and see where they got stuck so I could make changes to improve usability. I also realized that most of the changes needed were minor compared to my previous projects.</p>

                <h3>High Fidelity Wireframe & Responsive Designs</h3>
                <p>After reviewing my feedback, I went ahead and applied the needed changes to my next wireframe. By this point, I felt like my app was coming together quite well, even though I still had more to do. I also had to create a responsive design for a desktop version of the app. To save time I decided to create a custom layout grid to ensure adequate spacing between UI elements, which worked out well.</p>

                <h3>Creating Mockups</h3>
                <p>Making the mockups was the easier part of the project because I got to bring the previous project pieces together. Now it felt like my design decisions paid off.</p>

                <h3>Retrospective</h3>
                <p>In conclusion, I feel that this project went smoother than any of my previous projects. I do believe that the valuable lessons I learned along the way have made me a stronger designer. I was able to stick to my initial project schedule without sacrificing quality which makes me proud. In the future, I hope to continue to continue to progress and enjoy the process along the way.</p>
